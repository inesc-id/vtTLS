# vtTLS - vulnerability-tolerant Transport Layer Security.

vtTLS stands for vulnerability-tolerant Transport Layer Security.


## vtTLS Library - Modified OpenSSL

An implementation of the OpenSSL protocol with redundant channels to mask vulnerabilities.

[Source code](https://github.com/inesc-id/vtTLS/tree/master/library)

## vtTLS Tool - MultiTLS 

MultiTLS adds two layers of encryption so that the communication is secure even if a vulnerability is found in one of the layers. It does so using a tunneling approach that allows using multiple layers of encryption without modifying existing applications.
